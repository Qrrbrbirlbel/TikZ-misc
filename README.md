# Libraries for PGF or TikZ
See [the wiki](https://github.com/Qrrbrbirlbel/pgf/wiki) for a description of the libraries.

# Installation
There are two ways to install these custom libraries for use with one's own documents:

1. Placing them besides the document's main TeX file
2. Placing them in the local [texmf tree](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/420620/16595)
